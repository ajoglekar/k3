Kenken exploraiton

Kenken is a popular mathematical puzzle. This is an exploration of strategy for solving the puzzle with computer.

This is an np complete class problem. This project is exploring a 'devide and conquer' approach.
The target is to achieve a logarithmic cost of solving it (nlog(n)) and a less than polynomial increase in processing time when the puzzle size increases.

This is a working solution in java, with automated tests to solve 4x4 and 7x7 puzzles.

Working on a more formal cost analysis at present.
